## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Load the farmersmarket.db and browse its content
- Create a logical data model

<br>
If this is your first time in DB Browser for SQLite, the following instructions may help:

#### 1) Load Database
- Open DB Browser for SQLite
- Go to File > Open Database
- Navigate to your farmersmarket.db 
	- This will be wherever you cloned the GH Repo (within the **SQL** folder)
	- ![db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png)

#### 2) Configure your windows
By default, DB Browser for SQLite has three windows, with four tabs in the main window and three tabs in the bottom right window
- Window 1: Main Window (Centre)
	- Stay in the Database Structure tab for now
- Window 2: Edit Database Cell (Top Right)
- Window 3: Remote (Bottom Right)
	- Switch this to DB Schema tab (very bottom)

Your screen should look like this (or very similar)
![db_browser_for_sqlite.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite.png)

#### 3) The farmersmarket.db
There are 10 tables in the Main Window:
1) booth
2) customer
3) customer_purchases
4) market_date_info
5) product
6) product_category
7) vendor
8) vendor_booth_assignments
9) vendor_inventory
10) zip_data

Switch to the Browse Data tab, booth is selected by default

Using the table drop down at the top left, explore some of the contents of the database

<img src="./images/01_the_table_drop_down_at_the_top_left.png" width="200">

Move on to the Logical Data Model task when you have looked through the tables


### Build Logical Data Model

Recall during session 1:

I diagramed the following four tables:
- product
- product_category
- vendor
- vendor_inventory

 <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_logical_model_partial.png" width="500">


#### Prompt 1:
Choose two tables and create a logical data model. There are lots of tools you can do this (including drawing this by hand), but I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). 

A logical data model must contain:
- table name
- column names
- relationship type

Please do not pick the exact same tables that I have already diagrammed. For example, you shouldn't diagram the relationship between `product` and `product_category`, but you could diagram `product` and `customer_purchases`.

**HINTS**:
- You will need to use the Browse Data tab in the main window to figure out the relationship types.
- You can't diagram tables that don't share a common column
	- These are the tables that are connected
	- <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_conceptual_model.png" width="600">
- The column names can be found in a few spots (DB Schema window in the bottom right, the Database Structure tab in the main window by expanding each table entry, at the top of the Browse Data tab in the main window)

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 2*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### SELECT
1. Write a query that returns everything in the customer table.
2. Write a query that displays all of the columns and 10 rows from the customer table, sorted by customer_last_name, then customer_first_ name.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### WHERE
1. Write a query that returns all customer purchases of product IDs 4 and 9.
2. Write a query that returns all customer purchases and a new calculated column 'price' (quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty), filtered by vendor IDs between 8 and 10 (inclusive) using either:
	1.  two conditions using AND
	2.  one condition using BETWEEN

<div align="center">-</div>

#### CASE
1. Products can be sold by the individual unit or by bulk measures like lbs. or oz. Using the product table, write a query that outputs the `product_id` and `product_name` columns and add a column called `prod_qty_type_condensed` that displays the word ‚Äúunit‚Äù if the `product_qty_type` is ‚Äúunit,‚Äù and otherwise displays the word ‚Äúbulk.‚Äù

2. We want to flag all of the different types of pepper products that are sold at the market. Add a column to the previous query called `pepper_flag` that outputs a 1 if the product_name contains the word ‚Äúpepper‚Äù (regardless of capitalization), and otherwise outputs 0.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### JOIN
1. Write a query that `INNER JOIN`s the `vendor` table to the `vendor_booth_assignments` table on the `vendor_id` field they both have in common, and sorts the result by `vendor_name`, then `market_date`.

***

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 3*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### AGGREGATE
1. Write a query that determines how many times each vendor has rented a booth at the farmer‚Äôs market by counting the vendor booth assignments per `vendor_id`.
2. The Farmer‚Äôs Market Customer Appreciation Committee wants to give a bumper sticker to everyone who has ever spent more than $2000 at the market. Write a query that generates a list of customers for them to give stickers to, sorted by last name, then first name.
   
**HINT**: This query requires you to join two tables, use an aggregate function, and use the HAVING keyword.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Temp Table
1. Insert the original vendor table into a temp.new_vendor and then add a 10th vendor: Thomass Superfood Store, a Fresh Focused store, owned by Thomas Rosenthal
   
**HINT**: This is two total queries -- first create the table from the original, then insert the new 10th vendor. When inserting the new vendor, you need to appropriately align the columns to be inserted (there are five columns to be inserted, I've given you the details, but not the syntax)

To insert the new row use VALUES, specifying the value you want for each column:  
`VALUES(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5)`

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Date
1. Get the customer_id, month, and year (in separate columns) of every purchase in the customer_purchases table.
   
**HINT**: you might need to search for strfrtime modifers sqlite on the web to know what the modifers for month and year are!

2. Using the previous query as a base, determine how much money each customer spent in April 2022. Remember that money spent is `quantity*cost_to_customer_per_qty`.
   
**HINTS**: you will need to AGGREGATE, GROUP BY, and filter...but remember, STRFTIME returns a STRING for your WHERE statement!!

### Ethics

Read: Qadri, R. (2021, November 11). _When Databases Get to Define Family._  Wired. <br>
    https://www.wired.com/story/pakistan-digital-database-family-design/

Link if you encounter a paywall: https://web.archive.org/web/20240422105834/https://www.wired.com/story/pakistan-digital-database-family-design/

**What values systems are embedded in databases and data systems you encounter in your day-to-day life?**

Consider, for example, concepts of fariness, inequality, social structures, marginalization, intersection of technology and society, etc.


```
The article discusses various implications of ideas and practices underpinning database development, suggesting that in a growing number of societies submitting personal data is becoming mandatory for citizens. For example, in Pakistan being included a national database is not optional for citizens but rather a step towards accessing government services. Moreover, in that country government databases tend to impose strict moral values upon households, sometimes with devastating consequences for individuals that are not able to access services because the database deems them to be ‚Äúunworthy‚Äù (for example, due to them being born out of wedlock). 
Importantly, the article suggests that in the pre-computer era it was possible for such citizens to "slip through the cracks", but today it is becoming increasingly difficult. Databases are thus are both an expression of politics and a political tool, and their design is contingent upon many factors, including the state's security considerations. In this case of Pakistan, the state wants to store individuals' private details in order for them to be considered first-rate citizens, as opposed to someone with no roots or history. This made me reflect on the much-discussed concept of ‚Äúsocial credit‚Äù underpinning the giant system Chinese government uses to track and evaluate individual citizens‚Äô loyalty and trustworthiness. As often suggested by Western media, this system is potentially even more intrusive than the Pakistani one, because in its complete form it is supposed to collect information about every transgression every Chinese citizen has committed throughout their lives. At the same time, the discussion of the social credit system in the West is politicized, considering the antagonism between China and the West. 
Regardless of the true scope of such data collection systems, there are several issues that need to be considered. First, as the Pakistani example shows, personal data collection itself may be intrusive if intimate details about individuals are collected. Second, database breaches are common; for example, in Russia taxpayer information, customer purchases, cellphone and email databases ‚Äì all obtained legally by government agencies - are regularly sold on the black market, despite government crackdowns on illegal data vendors. Third, it is perhaps unrealistic to avoid data collection, considering that governments are increasingly adopting business practices such cost-efficiency measures or key performance indicators, and matching individuals to services is becoming ever more important as govenrments expand their reach. Rather than fear of data, perhaps it is necessary for societies to discuss more ethical data collection and storage.  
Here, the article suggests two approaches. One is technocratic: how can we anticipate changes in database design? The other one is sociopolitical: how can we protect individual rights from politicization and digitalization? Considering the complexity of the issue, society‚Äôs answer should perhaps combine both approaches, bearing in mind that the onus should be on data owners rather than on database designers. There is also a role for government regulations. Unfortunately, today data collection practices are not very transparent. For example, giant data collectors such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon are working with intelligence agencies, and some of them recently pledged their allegiance to Donald Trump whose presidency will unlikely be driven by human rights considerations. In their quest for deregulation, tech giants such as Elon Musk are criticizing government regulations in jurisdictions such as the European Union, pushing for less government control. These are worrying signs. In order to start addressing these challenges, citizens need to be aware of risks involved in data collection, and we should all be involved in the discussion of risk mitigation.
